							<p class="post_p">In this section we present the documentation of our stylistic choices for each theme. It includes references to our sources of guidance and inspiration, credits for any material we do not own and our reasoning behind our decisions regarding layout and typography.   </p>
							
							<p class="post_p"><b> Incunabulum (early prints) theme</b> </p>
					
							<p class="post_p"> The contribution of the <i><a href="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html">History of Layout Design</a></i> has been fundamental for the completion of this project. As regards the theme of the early prints, it is mentioned that incunabula often included illuminations and ornamental designs, which we tried to capture with the background pictures used as borders and top and bottom illustrations. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp">W3C</a> was of assistance in placing the background images(in order of occurence) for their displaying properly. We reproduced the layout of the internally asymmetric columns, due to left-ranged lettering, but ensured that the columns were aligned with each other. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1">W3C</a> has once more been helpful with guidelines about designing a multi-column layout. The feature of the distinct appearance of the first letter of the first paragraph was also retained; it was a common phenomenon that this letter was bigger than the others and colored red. <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/first-letter/">Tympanus</a> offered valuable insight about styling said letter. Despite the distribution of text in columns, the early prints were not as dense as manuscripts; we made an effort to follow this fashion. In the chapter the use of bordering is also mentioned, and we used this feature to style our headings and pictures. 

							</p>
							<p class="post_p"> At this point, we should mention certain sources of inspiration that supplemented the theoretical overview provided by the aforementioned chapter with real examples. Stumbling on an interesting <a href="http://www.medievalcodes.ca/2015/07/pick-up-any-modern-printed-book-at_15.html"> project </a>, we got the idea of using images of the first editions of famous novels as guidance. For example, in the first edition of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> the images were black and white, a feature which we adopted in this theme, although colors are being used in incunabula (for example in image captions, which we also adopted), as can be seen in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjFpof4vNPkAhUCaFAKHfLrARoQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fballiollibrary.wordpress.com%2Ftag%2Fincunabula%2F&psig=AOvVaw04SML8gACv_woLA3PFwjfJ&ust=1568659162317046">pictures</a>. Considering that photography was not yet invented, we adopted the grayscale filter of the images according to the first example, and retained the color red for the decoration of the page, following the second example. The first edition of the Canterbury Tales also assisted in the designing of the title, since title pages were not very common in the early days of print. Certain elements like tables and blockquotes (the styling of which was facilitated thanks to this <a href="https://htmldog.com/techniques/pullquotes/"> site</a>), which were not usually, or not at all, employed then, were styled in a fashion, so as to harmoniously match the rest of the content.
							</p>
							<p class="post_p"> The final contribution of the History of Layout Design was the detailed description of the golden ratio. Since we employed a single-page layout, instead of the two-page layout on which the golden ratio was usually applied, and we used columns, the width of which cannot be modified once their number is defined, we made an effort to apply the golden dimensions to the borders using padding. According to the chapter, the margin should be set as the 1/9 of the whole page (1/9 x 1349 = 149,8), so we set the padding to 150px (11.1%), apart from the bottom padding which is supposed to be twice as that, so we set it at 22.2%. We referred to a <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/2575/golden-ratio-with-or-without-padding-margin">post</a> and a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enIT837IT837&biw=1366&bih=625&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=4f5vXc6EJKGnrgSi457AAQ&q=golden+ratio+in+book+design&oq=+golden+ratio+in+boo&gs_l=img.1.0.0l2.36500.43466..45633...4.0..0.185.1706.1j11......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......35i39j0i67j0i8i30j0i24.obl0VlGQI5o#imgrc=Xqcq95MXwE4mCM: ">picture</a> for ideas. A related <a href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/MedievalSharp"> project</a> also inspired us to use the Medieval Sharp font, which was chosen also for its resemblance to the fonts of that time, and organize our layout. 
							Finally, we should give credits to the images we used for decoration (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enIT837IT837&biw=1366&bih=625&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=B75TXe7uCNn9gAbYspj4Dg&q=ornament+page+transparent&oq=ornament+page+transparent&gs_l=img.3...9747.13645..13964...0.0..0.215.1704.0j12j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i67j0j0i7i30j0i8i30j0i7i5i30j0i5i30.a4WqXICxBZQ&ved=0ahUKEwiujuLy8IHkAhXZPsAKHVgZBu8Q4dUDCAY&uact=5#imgrc=WurnElUuPtzXCM:">top and bottom</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enIT837IT837&biw=1366&bih=625&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=OnpVXdWpEKvHrgSjw7mAAQ&q=medieval+designs+and+patterns&oq=medieval+designs+&gs_l=img.1.1.0i67j0l4j0i30j0i5i30l4.12609.12911..15321...0.0..0.297.805.2-3......0....1..gws-wiz-img.UR5OBfy9XRY#imgdii=elyh9CG_Bnb9YM:&imgrc=rge9hbKKUaDxqM:"> borders</a>) and paper-like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjL3tT4rM7kAhWCZVAKHZwQCK8QjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videoblocks.com%2Fvideo%2Fnature-old-paper-texture-or-background-video-animation-htdkmvszioea4vhh&psig=AOvVaw2MA0bIrqapgvCcEr6nSU-w&ust=1568482681218252">background</a>. We retrieved our second font, Uncial Antiqua, which was chosen due to its characterization as 'medieval' and used for the headings and image captions, from this <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/uncial-antiqua-font.html">site</a>. We confronted the issue of the image caption being separated from the image due to the columnised layout following the guidelines of this <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/css-multiple-column-layout-multicol/ ">site</a>. Lastly, we set the page dimensions in case of printing, according to the dimensions we found in this <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Bridwell/SpecialCollectionsandArchives/Exhibitions/ShapeofContent/SizeandFormat/SizeandFormat"> article</a> and using the guidelines of this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page/size#Syntax">site.</a>

							<p class="post_p"><b>Futuristic (2020-2040) theme<b></p>
							<p class="post_p">The futuristic theme was a particularly interesting challenge, considering the limited amount of reliable information one could gather on something that has not occurred yet and for which only predictions by specialists may be trusted. We made an effort to collect insight from valid sources, but in this case we had to exercise more creativity, when compared to the rest of the themes. </p>
							<p class="post_p">According to the guidelines given for this project, trending features are the use of the glitch effect, which subtly features in the background <a href="https://st.depositphotos.com/3394007/4969/v/950/depositphotos_49697753-stock-illustration-abstract-gray-pixel-background.jpg">image</a> for this theme. Intending to accommodate the constrasting trends of black-and-white minimalism and bright colors, we decided to turn the background into black, use white font and the css saturate filter on the images. We adopted a minimal style in the design of tables, as well. In the heading we integrated the trends of animations and 3D objects. The heading appears three-dimensional thanks to the css text shadow effect and animated through the use of css keyframes. Credits for this effect should be given to this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/3d-text-tower/"> post</a>. Another interesting trend is the presence of geometric, natural shapes, which led us to setting this <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiD7PKF4dPkAhVEJlAKHTN5BeoQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeoplepng.com%2Fabstract-borders-png%2F33287%2Ffree-vector&psig=AOvVaw3MjXsDKQcY1ZsxUlMX-Q0q&ust=1568668862727930">image</a> as background, after changing its color to white, always keeping in mind our minimal, black-and-white setting.</p>
							<p class="post_p">The fonts used for this theme were found under the tag "futuristic" in this <a href=" https://www.1001fonts.com/futuristic+google-web-fonts.html">site</a>. Certain elements, like the subheadings, were attributed a neon glow, which is nothing but text shadow. This clever trick was included in this W3C <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_text-shadow.asp
							"> entry</a>. The neon effect is also employed at the inset bordering of the image captions, which resembles malfunctioning neon signs. Neon signs were also the inspiration for the text decoration framing the headings. Nothing solid could be found about the exact layout of the page, apart from the use of space. Thus, we attempted to create an unconventional, sparse layout. What could not be supported by 'theory', we employed by referring to images of futuristic <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjk9-CA3dPkAhVGLVAKHepoBhYQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F39195459234844418%2F&psig=AOvVaw3TA_4px85Wkd2quEnwwezD&ust=1568667778704052">layouts</a> of magazines and sci-fi movies, like Matrix. For example, we designed the blockquotes to appear in vertical orientation, much like the characteristic writing of the aforementioned movie. </p>
							<p class="post_p"><b> 19th century theme (Newspaper style of the second half of 19th century)</b> </p>
					
							<p class="post_p"> According to the <i><a href="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html">History of Layout Design</a></i>, the 19th century was a period of change for the newspaper world. New machines introduced the mechanical aspect in printing, making it easier to manage and faster to produce. The main problem though, was that this innovation wasn’t supported by equally innovative graphics, thus often resulting in overcrowded pages. This theme draws inspiration from the US layout style found in several images stored in the Library of Congress <a href="https://www.loc.gov/"> website</a> and in particular, the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?dates=1800-1899&fa=segmentof:sn83030180/1898-10-17/ed-2/%7Cpartof:new+york+journal+and+related+titles,+1896-1899%7Csubject:united+states&sb=shelf-id&st=slideshow#slide-1"> New York Journal</a>. Looking at the first page of the journal the first thing that one notices is the high number of columns, between six and nine, scarcely interrupted with spaces and completely filled with text. The relevant W3C <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp"> tutorial</a> was essential in understanding how to use columns in a responsive way and modify them, in order to give to the reader the same feeling of saturation of the page. To do so the width of each column has been set to 170px, which is equivalent to 1/7 of the page with a small 1em gap, in order to keep the content legible but not leave a lot of space. 

							</p>
							<p class="post_p"> With relevant <a href="https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?dates=1800-1899&fa=segmentof:sn83030180/1898-10-17/ed-2/%7Cpartof:new+york+journal+and+related+titles,+1896-1899%7Csubject:united+states&sb=shelf-id&st=slideshow#slide-4"> pictures </a> as guidance, the pictures of the document have been modified with black and white filter, in an attempt to simulate the black and white drawings of the time. They have been set to be slighty smaller than a column (92% of it) to allow the insertion of a dotted black border, which has been employed with the purpose to divide them from the text. The same technique has been applied to image captions, which have been framed by a solid border at the top and bottom of the caption. The text, as can be seen in the reference images, was typed in a small font, with no space in between; the only typographical connotation was the small gap left at the beginning of a new paragraph. This has then been reproduced by setting the paragraphs to be of 15px. Furthermore, no space has been left between the different paragraphs. Finally this <a href="w3c https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-indent.asp">entry </a> provided the guidelines for the insertion of an indentation in the first line of each paragraph. Following the example of the newspaper images, the text has been made of a grey color, to represent old and faded text in a serif font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Old+Standard+TT"> Old Standard</a>, that mimics a font used  in various editions of the late 19th and early 20th century.  </p>
							<p class="post_p">  The title of the article, as well as the subheading and name of the author (when present) have been used to reproduce the title section of the first page of newspapers. In particular, the title of the article assumes the role of the name of the journal by being positioned in the centre of the page, and presented in a serif font (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display">Playfair display</a>), with a size of 30 px and a bold weight, which served the purposes of disproportion between title and text. Next, we secluded it from the rest of the page by using a solid border above and below it. The subheading and author name have been instead aligned (when possible) as inline block elements and set to float on the same line, divided by a solid border. The size has been set as slightly smaller(25px) than the title, to signal the hierarchy, but not lessen their importance.</p>
							<p class="post_p"> Margins have been set to accommodate the small space left on all sides by regular newspapers. The gap was small (just a couple of cm on all sides according to this <a href="https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?dates=1800-1899&fa=segmentof:sn83030180/1898-10-17/ed-2/%7Cpartof:new+york+journal+and+related+titles,+1896-1899%7Csubject:united+states&sb=shelf-id&st=slideshow#slide-1)">source</a>), and less on the bottom to ensure that a page wouldn’t be <a href="https://www.prepressure.com/printing/history/1800-1849"> ruined </a> by the press machine. Since all newspapers had a slightly different gap, depending on the machine and on the editorial choice, we tried reproducing this inconsistence by setting the margin bottom to  30 px and the others to 35 px. Finally, the background was chosen with the purpose of simulating old paper, so a slightly grey color(#f4f4e2) was employed, along with an image replicating the texture of the old paper used for journals. </p>
							<p class="post_p"><b>Early 20th century – Constructivism<b></p>
							<p class="post_p"><a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/easy-guide-design-movements-constructivism-10134843">Constructivism</a> is an art movement born in Russia in 1913 and influenced by cubism and Bauhaus. Its features include an abstract visual grammar with remarkable consistency across a wide range of design disciplines. In this style we draw inspiration from Russian Constructivist posters, which are readapted to place focus on text, as required for the purposes of this project, instead of images. </p>
							<p class="post_p">As can be seen in various <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=constructivism+posters&rlz=1C1CHBF_itIT812IT813&sxsrf=ACYBGNQ6PGucSPKmxhC_rwm00zwsKCYHhw:1569146570306&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiq7G_luTkAhUD2KQKHeCxDgMQ_AUIEigB&biw=1707&bih=838&dpr=1.13">posters</a>, text is usually presented not in the traditional horizontal fashion, but vertical or slanting. Thus we decided to present the heading on the left side in a vertical alignment, and the text in an oblique setting. The text orientation for the headings was also set to be vertical. The text does not wrap, in an attempt to be faithful to the Constructivist visual <a href="https://creativepro.com/russian-constructivism-and-graphic-design/"> style</a> of clean lines, simple geometry and extensive white spaces. Furthermore, the heading section has been enriched with a red background color alongside a textured background, with the intent to simulate the texture of paper glued to a wall. The headings have 2 different sans serif typefaces, which was a usual <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/movement/constructivism/"> phenomenon</a> in constructivism posters. Due to lack of information on the recommended or required size of the fonts, we made an arbitrary choice considering the impact of the headings and the text on attributing meaning to the artistic <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/easy-guide-design-movements-constructivism-10134843">choice</a>.</p>
							<p class="post_p">The article section has a textured background similar to the one of the headings but colored yellow, this time. The colors are consistently limited to red, yellow and black, because early constructivism  didn’t allow for more than these 3 basic colors. The text has been, as previously mentioned, slanted by rotating the text in 15 degree angle, in order to draw attention, but still be legible. To aid readability the size of the font is 20 px and a different font family is employed than the ones used in the headings, which also serves to maintain conformity with the style characteriscs.  Images and captions have been grouped in a single box thanks to the figure tag and have been differentiated by the body using a black colored border and the background color and texture of the title section. The images are in black and white and float on one side of the box, while the caption floats on the other. The box has been created by setting a maximum width and height in order to readapt itself, to a certain degree, to the presence of more pictures and of different length captions. </p>   
							<p class="post_p"><b> YugoYouth</b> </p>
					
							<p class="post_p"> Since the essence of this project is diversity, we decided to seek for inspiration in various cultures. Focusing on the period that came after the Second World War, the point of our interest was the territory of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the time, the entire newspapers business was under the control of the new communist regime, which controlled all the information aimed to be transmitted to the general public. Although the period was marked by strong need to impose the communist ideology and to fight political enemies in the country, through written media, during the '50s the newspapers became more independent, and the majority of the material was coming from the West. (https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/162816)  In that atmosphere, youth and students’ newspapers from Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana and other cities started to profile into the independent type of periodicals with specific <a href="https://www.b92.net/kultura/moj_ugao.php?nav_category=1086&yyyy=2015&mm=05&nav_id=991390">characteristics</a>.</p>
							<p class="post_p"> These young and enthusiastic journalists found their inspiration mainly within British and American underground press that was rebelling against the dullness of mainstream media.  Carried by this torrent, they experimented with content and forms, since they were mainly attracted by the alternative hippie lifestyle. One of the greatest accomplishments of this <a href="http://www.seebiz.eu/omladinska-stampa-u-jugoslaviji-kao-underground-press/ar-110872/">period</a> was bringing to life the culture of rock and roll within the pages of periodicals themselves. In order to represent this spirit through a style, we found inspiration in the music magazine called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%BEuboks"> Džuboks</a>, which was the first Yugoslav <a href="http://www.popboks.com/dzuboks/dzubrowser.html 1974">magazine</a> dedicated to  rock music and the very first rock music magazine to be published in a communist country. </p>
							<p class="post_p">Although the story behind the creation of the magazine is rather complicated, its design, on the other hand, is quite simple. The predominant colour was definitely black. Not only a lot of cover pages had a black background, the same layout was used for the majority of pages within the periodical itself, along with the white font. In spite of the colour selection being mainly reduced to black and white, they were experimenting with fonts, title and photo positioning, different kinds of margins, which resulted in a vast variety of layouts, always accompanied by the black-and-white theme. However, there would always be a very few pages for which colours were used; colour combinations, such as red and pink, yellow and red, purple and yellow, weren’t rare. One of the styles of this project, called YugoYouth, aims to represent exactly that: an eye-catching title with a text enclosed with a specific margin, accompanied by noticeable colour diversity.</p>

							<p class="post_p"><b> StructurSlavia</b> </p>
					
							<p class="post_p"> Moving towards the late 20th century, we decided to reside a little longer within the Balkan region and observe how the Yugoslav print media was changing, with a special attention given to the 1900s. Hence, on the contrary to the tendencies manifested within the YugoYouth style, the last few decades of the past century brought rather simple design ideas. However, simple doesn't automatically imply dull and monotonous intention. Rather, it seems like the print media wanted to transmit a clear message by emphasizing the text itself, and to that end, a lot of attention was focused on structure. By structure, we mean experimenting with headings and text positions and the way those are combined into a marked design whose primary intent is to stress the content of the periodical. </p>
							<p class="post_p">In order to understand the design tendencies, we attempted to browse through some of the most famous periodicals of the time, such as satirical one - <a href="http://istorijskenovine.unilib.rs/view/index.html#issue:UB_00072_20000401">Ošišani jež</a> and <a href="http://istorijskenovine.unilib.rs/view/index.html#issue:UB_00060_19900901">Bitef</a>, which was an artistic magazine designed for the promotion of performing arts. Both of these, as well as many others, were marked by horizontal and, particularly, vertical headings, while the text itself was either distributed in columns or was divided in smaller sections and wrapped with a border. As far as alignment of the text is concerned, it was mainly left aligned, which helped to break the continuous precision of the structure. It’s worth mentioning that the colour palette used for designing was reduced to black, grey and white. Therefore, for this project, we tried to incorporate all of the aforementioned characteristics in a style called StructurSlavia,the main goal of which is to place an emphasis on the headings, along with the neatly defined structure of the text.</p>
